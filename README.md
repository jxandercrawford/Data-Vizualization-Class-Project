# Feed Grain Crop Supply and Disappearance

### Feed Grains

Feed grains are classified as a crop that is used for feeding livestock (i.e. Chicken, Pigs, Cattle, and etc.). The USDA keeps annual records of the harvest of these crops in the United States. These metrics are collected via sampling done by the USDA. To learn more about how the USDA gathers these metrics visit here.

Feed grains are a vital part of the United States agriculture industry and have been throughout the years. In 2020 area of feed grains harvested accounted for approximately 4.8% of the continental United States land area. For reference Pennsylvania is approximately 1.5% of the land area of the continental United States.

## Feed Grain Supply
The USDA keeps metrics for each feed grain crops supply. These metrics are available for download here. This data began being kept fully in 1930. The supply of feed grains is kept in multiple metrics, but the metric used here is the production. The production is the measured amount harvested typically in bushels.

Of all feed grains in 2020, corn is by far the most prevalent crop with approximately 90.9% of all areas harvested for all feed grains. Corn also accounted for approximately 95.9% of feed grain production in 2020. This staggering dominance has not always been the case. Corn has generally had the lead in total amount harvested (since USDA began keeping records) but not to the current extent.

## Feed Grain Crop Disappearance

The USDA keeps metrics for each feed grain crops disappearance or use. These metrics are available for download here. This data began being kept fully in 1975. The disappearance or use of each feed grain crop was broken down into 5 categories. Each category represents a how each crop was used. 

A brief description of each category
 * Food/Alcohol/Industrial: The use of a crop in domestic markets for human consumption.
 * Seed: The use of crop in domestic markets for planting purposes.
 * Feed: The use of a crop in domestic markets for animal consumption.
 * Exports: The exportation a crop to foreign markets.
 * End Stock: The amount of a crop not used in domestic or foreign markets.

In recent years the trend for the disappearance of feed grain crops has shown an increase in use for food, alcohol, and industrial purposes and a fall for all other purposes. The usage for feed purposes has dropped drastically across all feed grain crops. The average usage for food, alcohol, and industrial purposes increased by approximately 85.7% while the average usage for feed purposes has fallen approximately 35.2% from the average percent total used in the time spans of 1990 – 2005 to 2005 - 2020.

The radar plots below show the disappearance of feed grain crops harvested by the US from the years 1975 – 2020. These charts break down the disappearance into 15-year segments. The use of each crop in each category was averaged over the 15-year period then converted to percent total used for the 15-year span average. (Food/Alcohol/Industrial usage of barley from the years 1990 – 2005 was approximately %37 of all the barley harvested in those years)
