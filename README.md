# Feed Grain Crop Supply and Disappearance

### Abstract

The United States feed grain industry has comprehensive records kept on metrics such as supply and disappearance. This is a report introducing the sector and analyzing the trends within it using simple descriptive statistics and visualizations. All data used is kept by the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Services.

### Introduction

The United States agriculture industry is a staple of the United States industry and dinner tables. Farms directly contributed $136.1 billion to the United States GDP in 2019. (Zahniser, 2020) Of all communities in the agriculture market, feed grains have always held a considerable amount of market share. But what is the feed grain sector of United States agriculture? How large is the feed grain sector? How are these commodities used? How are these sectors' supply and disappearance evolved over the span of the last 100 years? Using the USDA Economic Research Services Feed Grain Yearbook we can peer into the sector and discover its role in the United States industry.

### Feed Grains

Feed grains are classified as a crop that is used for feeding livestock (i.e. Chicken, Pigs, Cattle, etc.). The USDA keeps annual records of the harvest of these crops in the United States. These metrics are collected via sampling done by the USDA. (Vogel & Bange, 1999) To learn more about how the USDA gathers these metrics visit <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Education_and_Outreach/Understanding_Statistics/pub1554.pdf" target="_blank">here<a>.

Feed grains are a vital part of the United States agriculture industry and have been throughout the years. In 2020 area of feed grains harvested accounted for approximately 4.7% of the continental United States land area. For reference, Pennsylvania is approximately 1.5% of the land area of the continental United States.

### Feed Grain Supply
The USDA keeps metrics for each feed grain crops supply. These metrics are available on data.gov for download <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/feed-grains-database">here<a>. This data began being kept fully in 1930. The supply of feed grains is kept in multiple metrics, but the metric used here is the production. The production is the measured amount harvested typically in bushels.

Of all feed grains in 2020, corn is by far the most prevalent crop with approximately 90.9% of the area harvested for all feed grains. Corn also accounted for approximately 95.9% of feed grain production in 2020. This staggering dominance has not always been the case. Corn has generally had the lead in total amount harvested (since USDA began keeping records) but not to the current extent. (McConnell & Capehart, 2021)

### Feed Grain Disappearance

The USDA keeps metrics for each feed grain crop's disappearance or use. These metrics are available on data.gov for download <a target="_blank" href="https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/feed-grains-database">here<a>. This data began being kept fully in 1975. The disappearance or use of each feed grain crop was broken down into 5 categories. Each category represents how each crop was used. 

#### A brief description of each category
 * Food/Alcohol/Industrial: The use of a crop in domestic markets for human consumption.
 * Seed: The use of a crop in domestic markets for planting purposes.
 * Feed: The use of a crop in domestic markets for animal consumption.
 * Exports: The exportation of a crop to foreign markets.
 * End Stock: The amount of a crop not used in domestic or foreign markets.

In recent years the trend for the disappearance of feed grain crops has shown an increase in use for food, alcohol, and industrial purposes and a fall for all other purposes. The usage for feed purposes has dropped drastically across all feed grain crops. The average usage for food, alcohol, and industrial purposes increased by approximately 85.7% while the average usage for feed purposes has fallen approximately 35.2% from the average percent total used in the periods of 1990 – 2005 to 2005 - 2020. (McConnell & Capehart, 2021)

The radar plots below show the disappearance of feed grain crops harvested by the US from the years 1975 – 2020. These charts break down the disappearance into 15-year segments. The use of each crop in each category was averaged over the 15-year period then converted to percent total used for the 15-year span average. (i.e. Food/Alcohol/Industrial usage of barley from the years 1990 – 2005 was approximately 37% of all the barley harvested in those years)

### Conclusion
  
  The feed grain sector of the United States agriculture industry is an expansive trade. It makes up approximately 4.8% of the continental United States land area in 2020. Corn is the largest commodity in the sector account for a large majority of the land area and production in 2020. The evolution of the sector has shown an increased production of corn in the past 90 years. The disappearance of feed grains has also evolved in the past 45 years. The use of which feed grains are named for, feed, is losing its share in the disappearance of the crops. This loss in feed share in the disappearance is paired with an explosion of the use of feed grains for human consumption. These trends have become especially pronounced in the past 30 years.
